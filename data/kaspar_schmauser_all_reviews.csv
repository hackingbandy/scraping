N√ºrnberg,"We chose this place as it looks quite fresh and had good reviews Unfortunately we had no luck. The table was dirty and I had to clean it myself, stuff was fairly communicable but waiting time was quite long The food was poor The rice very sticky and looked like yesterdays, the curry was not masala. Generally place is not worthy going there. Advantage is location but that‚Äôs it.",2,2025-03-22 17:01:39,Kris Kaz
N√ºrnberg,"I visited this establishment for lunch last week. The food was ok, I got a bowl with extra tuna, even though It wasn‚Äôt extra, it was a good bowl (thus 4 stars on food). Overall, the staff was nice and the food came quickly. Also they have electrical outlets all over the wall which help when travelling and need a place to charge. The prices were kind of hefty, but most of the restaurants of this category are kinda expensive and thus it is to be expected. The toilets were clean and free.
Overall, it was a good lunch and a interesting experience.",5,2025-03-07 23:05:14,Dimitris Karyamis
N√ºrnberg,It is a super cute restaurant with focus on vegetarian/vegan meal options. The bowl is very fulfilling and a portion. I tried the winter bowl and it was tasty! And the ordering is easy and fast with the self ordering.,5,2025-03-04 10:08:32,Burcu Yigit
N√ºrnberg,"Pro tip: if kiosks are busy, you can order at the table via QR code. Too bad the waiter didn‚Äôt tell us this when we asked if we had to order at the kiosk.

The experience was slightly ruined by having to wait for 10 minutes to order at a kiosk and then rushed through our order as there were people queuing behind us. We had to clean the table ourselves and I am pretty sure our order was messed up a bit - but the machine didn‚Äôt give is a receipt so we would not know.

The food was nice, but I have never been at a vegan place with less atmosphere than this.",3,2025-04-13 21:21:50,Vojtƒõch Kotek
N√ºrnberg,Great vegan options - super delicious and healthy with a nice patio,5,2025-03-07 12:19:26,Michelle Lewis
F√ºrth,"The order process via tablets is easy, you can deselect ingredients or add toppings. Portions are very generous. I would love a bit more variety, but I understand you need to keep a few basic ingredients. The lunch deal with a drink for 1.90 is very nice, especially the warm lemonades.",4,2024-10-05 21:20:49,Ylva ChasingButterflies
F√ºrth,"What you expect, fresh delicious bowls with a ton of varieties..the gentleman working inside was super super polite and very helpful for my first time ordering here. The place is very nice and room for plenty in or outside. I ordered the avocado super food and pasta bowl and I tried all the dressings the himbeer mango and pesto dressings were my favorite.",5,2024-07-09 17:13:40,Phillip Bono
F√ºrth,"This is a great vegan option in F√ºrth! The food is really good, tasty and fresh. The staff is friendly and has a cozy atmosphere.

Leipzig,"Really friendly staff and yummy bowls! Would highly recommend if you are looking for a causal place and want a healthy lunch/dinner. You can either choose the given bowls or create your own. The staff is very friendly and forthcoming. We had a NeoTaste voucher so paid about 11‚Ç¨ each for each bowl, usually they are about 15-17‚Ç¨ each which is a bit too expensive even though you get big portions and it‚Äôs all fresh! They don‚Äôt have the soda classics but offer a variety of house made lemonades.",5,2024-12-28 21:17:28,Ari Blenks
Leipzig,Really nice place. Huge portions. Had the Indian salad with mango sauce. A bit pricey for me but worth it.,5,2024-12-22 17:28:33,Dave Ra
Leipzig,"After seeing the great reviews about this place I was really excited to try their food, but I was very disappointed.

The presentation was pretty good, the veggies were fresh, and portions were good. However everything was incredibly bland and had almost no seasoning‚Ä¶ The chili did not taste like a chili at all, the thai bowl was more like a salad with no dressing (I added the recommended sauce).

I think that the bowls have a lot of potential especially with the vegan meat, just would be much better with more (a LOT more) flavour.",3,2024-01-24 01:39:02,yoobin
Leipzig,"The best food I've ever had in a restaurant. I visited a lot of vegan ones, this one was the best. I had a kebab bowl and it was very flavourful and all the ingredients were fresh. I liked that there was a possibility to order from a machine at the entrance and there were electric sockets near tables. And the place itself was gorgeous with good music.",5,2023-09-30 18:01:24,Anna Tom√°≈°ov√°

Essen,Found this place on Happy Cow. Always nice to have vegan restaurants available. Service was really friendly and helpful. The food is great! We had the Korean Kimchi bowl and the Masala chicken Curry. Both very tasty!,5,2025-04-07 21:24:50,Kevin VH
Essen,"I would give this restaurant 6 stars if I could! It's like the cleanest restaurant I've ever been to! Beautiful aesthetic and atmosphere. As a vegetarian lost in a sea of meat-focused stands and restaurants during my visit to the Essen Christmas Market, this restaurant was super calm; a nice peaceful oasis in the busy streets of Essen during December. It was nice to be able to relax here, unwind and enjoy some incredible vegan food. The menu is fantastically diverse - it was almost impossible to make a decision! Everything was customizable for allergies or preferences and the prices are very affordable. All the food and drinks were very tasty. The vegan tuna is mindblowing! The staff is very nice and helpful. Even the toilets were pristine. Genuinely a perfect restaurant and I'd love to come back soon! :) ‚ô•Ô∏è",5,2024-12-15 19:04:25,Manou van der Meer
